# Fake News Detector Based on Neural Networks

## Problem Description

### Context

The spread of fake news significantly increased starting from the COVID-19 pandemic. These fake news represent an alarming problem because they can influence people's behavior, leading them to undertake activities they would not normally engage in or act chaotically. For example, fake news about the harm caused by 5G technology to the human body led many people in the UK to burn telecommunications towers, even when these were not 5G.

### Project Objective

To combat this problem, the development of a fake news pre-detector system based on neural networks has been commissioned, aimed at helping fact-checkers worldwide. This system must be capable of:

- Identifying fake news with high accuracy.
- Providing a support tool for fact-checkers, facilitating the news verification process.

### Data

The system will use a dataset containing news labeled as true or false. These news items include various textual features that will be used to train and validate the neural network model.

### Methodology

The solution to this problem will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather a set of labeled news and prepare the data for use in the model.
2. **Neural Network Model Development**: Design, train, and optimize a neural network model capable of classifying news as true or false.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and make necessary adjustments to improve its accuracy.
4. **Implementation and Deployment**: Develop a user interface so that fact-checkers can efficiently use the system.

### Tools and Technologies

The project will be carried out using tools and technologies such as:

- Python for model development.
- TensorFlow for neural network construction.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- NLTK for natural language processing.

### Expected Results

By the end of the project, it is expected to have:

- A neural network model that can identify fake news with high accuracy.
- An easy-to-use tool for fact-checkers, helping them verify news more efficiently.
- A detailed report documenting the process, findings, and recommendations.
