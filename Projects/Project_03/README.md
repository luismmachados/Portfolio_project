# Salary Prediction and Classification for Job Applicants

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop two models:

1. **Salary Prediction Model**: Predict the expected salary of each applicant based on their characteristics.
2. **Classification Model**: Determine whether an applicant is likely to be hired based on their characteristics.

### Methodology

The solution to this problem will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Understand the distribution and relationship between the provided characteristics.
2. **Feature Transformation and Encoding**: Apply appropriate transformations to the features, including scaling and label encoding.
3. **Salary Prediction**: Use linear regression to predict the salary expectations.
4. **Classification**: Use a classification algorithm to predict whether an applicant will be hired.

### Tools and Technologies

The project will be carried out using tools and technologies such as:

- **Python** for model development.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** for feature transformation, regression, and classification techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and presentation of the analysis.

### Expected Results

By the end of the project, it is expected to have:

- A linear regression model that can accurately predict the salary expectations of applicants.
- A classification model that can correctly classify whether an applicant will be hired based on their characteristics.
