## Problem Description

The dataset from Google Play Store applications has tremendous potential to drive the success of companies creating apps. Practical insights can be extracted to help developers work and capture the Android market.

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Google Play Store apps data to gain valuable insights that can help developers enhance their applications and capture a larger market share. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Understand the distribution and relationship between the characteristics of the apps.
2. Predict ratings based on the provided features.
3. Classify apps into categories based on their features.

### Methodology

The solution to this problem will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Understand the distribution and relationship between the provided characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, transform features, and prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Cleaning special characters and text using NLTK tools, handling categorical features, joining features and removing others, embedding implementation.

4. **Model Development**: 
- **Regression Models**: Predict app ratings using models like RandomForestRegressor, BaggingRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor and TPOTRegressor.
- **Classification Models**: Classify apps into categories using models like RandomForestClassifier, BaggingClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier.

### Tools and Technologies

The project will be carried out using tools and technologies such as:

- **Python** for model development.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization data.
- **NLTK Tools** for text cleaning
- **Scikit-learn** for feature transformation, regression, and classification techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and presentation of the analysis.

### Expected Results

By the end of the project, it is expected to have:

- A detailed analysis of the distribution and relationship between app characteristics.
- Regression models that can accurately predict app ratings.
- Classification models that can correctly classify apps into categories based on their features.
