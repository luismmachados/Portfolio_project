# Customer Segmentation for Financial Product

## Problem Description

A financial company has launched a new product aimed at its clients, which offers different credit limits. To maximize the efficiency and personalization of this product, it is necessary to divide clients into smaller and more homogeneous groups.

Currently, the company's executives are unclear about the optimal number of groups in which clients can be segmented, nor how to classify new clients into these groups.

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model that allows:

1. **Determining the optimal number of customer segments** based on the provided characteristics.
2. **Assigning each existing client to one of these segments**.
3. **Directing new clients to the defined segments** based on their characteristics.

### Methodology

The solution to this problem will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Understand the distribution and relationship between the provided characteristics.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Use clustering techniques to identify the optimal number of segments and assign existing clients to these segments.
3. **Development of a Classification Model**: Create a model that can classify new clients into the defined segments based on their characteristics.

### Tools and Technologies

The project will be carried out using tools and technologies such as:

- **Python** for model development.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering and classification techniques.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and presentation of the analysis.

### Expected Results

By the end of the project, it is expected to have:

- A set of well-defined customer segments.
- A classification model that can correctly assign existing and new clients to these segments.
